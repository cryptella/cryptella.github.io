<B>The sex battle system explanation:</B><BR>
It is the non realtime method that a player
and an enemy attack in turn.<BR>
About excitement level:<BR>
It ascends to heaven and it is defeated when
becoming excitement level max. <BR>
It uses becoming, Energy water and Cool gel
and Guardian angel's tear to lower the excitement
level. <BR>
It usable to many times in the map field,
but it can use only once by one turn at sex
battle.<BR>
It use the supplement to raise the upper
limit value. (Supplement A:20%up Supplement
S:30%up) <BR>
If both are used, it becomes 20% + 30% =

Every each point, it rises ones.<BR>
<BR>
Example1 of calculating attack value.<BR>
Basic value:10 + Aroma light:2 + Mouth spray:2
+ Mens gel:2 + Precoital play point:3 = 19<BR>
<BR>
Example2 of calculating attack value.(When
the insert attack.)<BR>
Basic value:30 + Aroma light:2 + Green incense:4
+ Aquamanta:15 + Precoital play point:8 =
59<BR>
<FONT size="-1">*A value of an Aquamanta is decided by possessing
rotor. If it's a pink rotor, it's 15. If
it's a Golden rotor, it's 49. <BR>

<P>Regulations at input by codes:<BR>
It must input a finish code in the last of
the cord by all means.( u, v, w, x, y, z
)<BR>
The code since &quot;v&quot; is canceled
and becomes &quot;...u&quot; if it is input
as &quot;...uvw&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
About an exception cord &quot;@&quot; ,&quot;!&quot;:<BR>
&quot;@&quot; is undressing all of upper-body.
&quot;!&quot; is a meaning of the code end.
<BR>
exanple: When Pie rub( &quot;e&quot; or &quot;v&quot;
) is specified with clothes parts remained
in upper body <BR>
when character that does Pie-rub is selected,
&quot;@&quot; is inserted automatically.
<BR>
&quot;!&quot; is inserted automatically at
the end. <BR>
<BR>
About the code conversion after the animated
cartoon ends:<BR>
Former code changes when return to a setting
screen after the end.<BR>
It was converted automatically. <BR>
<BR>
Exanple: When input with &quot;jx&quot;(Pie
licks -&gt; Insert1) at the time of Aya use,<BR>
it become &quot;UUjLLLx!&quot; after conversion.<BR>
<BR>
Because to do Pie licks and Insert1, the
undressing code &quot;U&quot;&amp;&quot;L&quot;
was inserted automatically.<BR>
( U:undressing all of upper body. L:undressing
all of lower body. )<BR>
When input with &quot;jx&quot; at the time
of Aqua Mineraly use in the same way, <BR>
it become &quot;UjLLLx!&quot; after conversion.<BR>
The reason is because the number of the clothes
parts wearing is different.<BR>

with pants, cord &quot;c&quot; (Unclothe

system):<BR>
When it possessed Normal Vibrator and Mega
piston, Mega piston of the higher model is
chosen.<BR>
The rotor and the pearl are also similar.
